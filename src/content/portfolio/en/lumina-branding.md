## The Brief

Lumina, a renewable energy provider, needed a brand refresh. Their old identity felt corporate and cold. They wanted something human, energetic, and optimistic.

## Visual Direction

We developed a color palette inspired by nature—sunlight yellows, deep ocean blues, and leaf greens. The new logo is dynamic, representing kinetic energy and movement.

### Deliverables
- **Logo Design**: A versatile mark working across digital and print.
- **Brand Guidelines**: A comprehensive style guide for consistency.
- **Marketing Collateral**: Business cards, letterheads, and social media assets.

## Result

The rebrand was met with enthusiasm from stakeholders and customers alike, helping Lumina close their Series B funding round.
