## Overview

NeoBank aimed to disrupt the traditional banking sector with a mobile-first approach. They needed an app that was not only secure but also delightful to use.

## The Problem

Traditional banking apps are often cluttered and confusing. NeoBank wanted to simplify the experience, making it easy for users to track spending, set budgets, and save for goals.

## Strategic Approach

We focused on a clean, minimalist design language with bold typography and clear data visualization. Security was paramount, implementing biometric authentication and end-to-end encryption.

### Key Features
- **Spending Insights**: AI-powered categorization of transactions.
- **Round-up Savings**: Automatically rounding up purchases to the nearest dollar.
- **Peer-to-Peer Payments**: Instant transfers to contacts.

## Outcome

The app achieved **1 million downloads** in the first 3 months and maintains a **4.8-star rating** on the App Store.
