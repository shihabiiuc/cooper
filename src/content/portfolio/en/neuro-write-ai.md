## Overview

NeuroWrite isn't just another autocomplete tool; it's a context-aware writing partner. We helped build the core platform from MVP to enterprise scale.

## The Vision

To empower marketing teams to maintain brand voice consistency across thousands of assets. The tool needed to learn from existing brand guidelines and enforce tone.

## Implementation

Built on top of GPT-4 with a custom fine-tuning layer. We implemented a collaborative editor using Yjs and Tiptap, allowing multiple users to edit documents simultaneously while the AI suggests improvements in real-time.

### Key Tech
- **Vector Database**: For fast retrieval of brand context.
- **Edge Functions**: Low-latency AI streaming responses.
- **Collaborative Editor**: Real-time multiplayer experience.

## Results

Adopted by 5 Fortune 500 companies in beta. Users report a **3x increase** in content production speed.
