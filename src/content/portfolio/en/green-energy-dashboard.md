## Overview

GreenEnergy Corp needed a way to visualize massive amounts of real-time data from their solar and wind farms. We built a high-performance dashboard that provides instant insights.

## The Challenge

Handling millions of data points per minute without causing UI lag. The system needed to be responsive and provide actionable alerts for maintenance teams.

## Solution

We utilized WebSockets for real-time data streaming and WebGL-powered charts for performant rendering. The interface is designed with a dark mode first approach to reduce eye strain for operators.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Grid Status**: Live map overlay of all energy node statuses.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: AI algorithms forecasting equipment failures.
- **Exportable Reports**: One-click PDF generation for stakeholders.

## Impact

Operational efficiency increased by **40%**, and downtime was reduced by **15%** within the first quarter of deployment.
