## The Challenge

The client, a leading fashion retailer, was struggling with a high cart abandonment rate and a dated mobile experience. They needed a modern, responsive storefront that would reflect their premium brand identity.

## Out Solution

We approached this project with a mobile-first mindset. 

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Instant Search**: Powered by Algolia for sub-20ms results.
- **Smart Filters**: Dynamic faceting based on user behavior.
- **One-Page Checkout**: Streamlined process reducing friction.

## Results

Post-launch, the client saw a **40% increase** in mobile conversions and a **25% decrease** in bounce rate.
