## Overview

In the wake of increased demand for remote healthcare, HealthTrack needed a robust, HIPAA-compliant mobile application to facilitate doctor-patient video calls.

## Security First

Building for healthcare means zero compromise on security. We implemented end-to-end encryption for all video calls and messaging, ensuring patient data remains private.

## User Experience

We focused on accessibility, ensuring the app was usable by elderly patients. Large touch targets, clear typography, and voice-assisted navigation were key accessibility features.

### Features
- **Secure Video Calls**: High-quality video with low bandwidth fallback.
- **E-Prescriptions**: Integrated directly with local pharmacies.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Real-time calendar sync for doctors.

## Outcome

HealthTrack Pro is now used by over **50 clinics** nationwide, processing thousands of secure consultations daily.
