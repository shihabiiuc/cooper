In the Tesseract, time was represented as infinite physical rooms.

## Gravity as a Pen

Cooper could exert force across time using gravity. Moving the books, the watch hand, the dust.

## Closing the Loop

He realized he was his daughter's "ghost" all along.

## Inter-dimensional Communication (Sequence)

sequenceDiagram
    actor C as Cooper (inside Tesseract)
    participant T as TARS (inside Tesseract)
    participant W as The Watch (Past/Present)
    actor M as Murph (Adult)

    Note over C, T: Singularity Data Collected
    T->>C: Transmits Quantum Data in Morse
    C->>W: Manipulates Second Hand via Gravity
    Note right of W: Morse: S-T-A-Y... then Quantum Data
    M->>W: Notices the ticking pattern
    M->>M: Realizes "The Ghost" is her father
    M->>M: Decodes Quantum Data
    Note over M: Solves Gravity Equation
    M-->>C: "Eureka!"
```
