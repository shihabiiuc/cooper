Accessibility (a11y) is often an afterthought. At Gladtek, it's a constraint we design around from day one.

## Color Contrast

Low contrast text is the most common failure on the web. Our themes are audited to meet **WCAG AA** standards. We use semantic colors (Foreground, Muted Foreground) to ensure readability in both light and dark modes.

## Semantic HTML

We don't use `div` soup.
- Navigation is in `<nav>`.
- Main content is in `<main>`.
- Articles are in `<article>`.

## Keyboard Navigation

Every interactive element—from our **Universal Search** modal to our **Cookie Consent** banner—is fully navigable via keyboard. We meticulously manage focus traps in modals so users never get "stuck".
