React Server Components (RSC) are changing the way we think about building React applications. By moving the logic to the server, we can reduce the bundle size and improve performance.

### Why RSC Matters

1. **Zero Bundle Size**: Server components are not sent to the client.
2. **Direct Database Access**: Query your database directly from your components.
3. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Client components are automatically code-split.

Astro has been a pioneer in the server-first approach, and with the new React integration, you can leverage the power of RSC within your Astro islands. This combination provides the best of both worlds: the interactivity of React and the performance of static HTML.
