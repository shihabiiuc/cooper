In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, starting a new project often involves a tedious setup process. Configuring build tools, setting up linters, designing a UI system, and ensuring SEO best practices can take days before writing a single line of business logic.

We built **Gladtek** to solve this problem.

## The Problem with "Empty" Starters

Most "minimal" starters are too minimal. They leave you to figure out:
- **SEO**: Meta tags, sitemaps, and robots.txt.
- **Performance**: Image optimization and bundle splitting.
- **Design**: A cohesive design system that looks good out of the box.

## The Gladtek Approach

Gladtek is opinionated but flexible. We made potential choices for you:
1.  **Astro**: For unbeatable static performance.
2.  **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development.
3.  **React**: For interactive islands where needed.

We believe that a boilerplate should be a **launchpad**, not just a blank canvas. It should inspire you to build something great immediately.
