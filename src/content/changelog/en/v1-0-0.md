We are finalizing the roadmap for our first major release. The focus is on three key pillars:

### 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)
We are building a robust i18n system from the ground up.
- **Multi-language Support**: Seamless routing for `en`, `fr`, `de`, and `ar`.
- **RTL Support**: First-class support for Right-to-Left languages like Arabic.
- **Type-safe Translations**: A type-safe dictionary for all UI components.

### � Search Capabilities
Integrating a powerful static search engine for instant results.
- **Pagefind Integration**: Zero-config, static search indexing.
- **Command Palette**: `Cmd+K` interface for quick navigation.
- **Multilingual Indexing**: Search results respect the current language.

### 🔓 Open Source
Preparing the repository for public release.
- **MIT License**: Fully open source for community use.
- **Contribution Guide**: Clear guidelines for contributors.
- **Public Repository**: Moving from private development to public GitHub repo.
